**Game Rules:** The game has a win and a loss condition. Basically, the game is won when the desired score is achieved, and the game is lost when the player dies. Players can see their health and score values in the upper left corner of their screens. In addition, the game consists of three levels that are linearly connected. As levels are completed the next will respectively be unlocked. Since level data is generically designed, it is very easy to add new levels by creating new _Level Data_.

## 2. Game Elements
**Player:** Players can move their ships with the primary finger touch. When the game starts, the player's ship automatically starts firing. Also, players have two skills that they can use by pressing skill buttons on the left. These are missile, a rocket giving incredible damage, and a shield that can also heal the player periodically (one health per second). Missile skill has five seconds and shield skill has ten seconds cool-down.

**Enemies:** There are three different enemy ships that can use different weapons such as lasers or rockets in the game. Although they can use weapons in different formations, their mobility is the same.

**Asteroids & Rocks:** In addition, there are two large and two small asteroids. When large asteroids are destroyed, they split into small rock pieces and randomly scatter around. Asteroids and rocks can cause serious damage to players.

**Power-ups:** When any of the enemies or asteroids are destroyed, there are two different boosters can possibly be spawned. One of them heals the player while the other enhances the laser projectiles.
